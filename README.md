OTP Verification System with Email using Python

Description: This Python code generates a random One-Time Password (OTP) and sends it to a user's email address for verification purposes. The user must enter the OTP to complete the verification process. The code uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send the email, and the email addresses can be customized as per the user's requirements. This OTP verification system can be used to secure online transactions, registrations, and other sensitive information that requires user authentication.
